# Angulardt Angular CRUD Application with Authentication

Project Overview

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Angular 18 that uses Firebase Authentication for user login and JSON Server as a local database. The project is designed to demonstrate the use of external providers for authentication and data handling. It aims to showcase my skills in implementing Firebase as an authentication provider while also managing local data with JSON Server for simplicity and ease of setup.
